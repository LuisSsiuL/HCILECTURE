        <a1 id="description">The TT RS 40 years of quattro draws on the power of the 2.5 TFSI engine from Audi Sport. The five
        -cylinder engine, which has won the “International Engine of the Year Award” nine years running, 
        produces 294 kW (400 PS) and develops maximum torque of 480 Nm (354.0 lb-ft). The quattro 
        permanent all-wheel drive distributes the power as required between the front and rear axles using a 
        multi-plate clutch. Wheel-selective torque control makes handling even more agile and safer. It gently
        brakes the wheels on the inside of the curve when cornering at speed while increasing the drive 
        torque to the wheels on the outside of the curve. The driver can influence the quattro drive and other
        components such as steering, seven-speed S tronic, exhaust flaps and engine characteristics using the 
        Audi drive select dynamic handling system.
